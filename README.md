# React basic concepts April-11-2019

This is little project creating a comment app using a functional component. 

I studied the following: 

- How to use a functional component with props.children
- Importing and using external package in react as such faker.js
- Nested components

Happy Coding ðŸ˜€.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
