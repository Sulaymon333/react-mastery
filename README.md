# React basic concepts April-13-2019

This is a personal study about the React class component. 

I studied the following: 

- Class based component
- Container component / state based component
- Structure of a React class based component
- Constructor method
- Render method
- Conditional rendering

Happy Coding ðŸ˜€.
