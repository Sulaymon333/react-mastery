# React functional component April-12-2019

This is about functional components in React.

I studied the following: 

- Structure of a functional component
- Presentational/ stateless component as functional component
- How to use eternal package such as faker.js in React project
- How to use props.children with functional component
  
Happy Coding ðŸ˜€.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
