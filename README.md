# React form handling April-29-2019

This is little fun personal learning of form handling in React.

I studied the following:

- How to render a mapped array in React
- How to structure components for a one page React app
- How to work with input, event handling and forms in React.
  
Happy Coding ðŸ˜€.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
