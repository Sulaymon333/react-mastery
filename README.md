# Mapping in React April-25-2019

This is about mapping in React.

I studied the following: 

- How to pass an array as props from parent to a child component
- How to use mapping of the passed props and return a JSX which can be rendered dynamically

  
Happy Coding ðŸ˜€.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
