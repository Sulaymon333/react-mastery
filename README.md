# React basic concepts April-13-2019

This is a personal study about the basic concepts of React technology. 

I studied the following: 

- React functional components
- Structure of a typical react component
- Styling in React
- Comments in React
- React project folder structure and so on

Happy Coding ðŸ˜€.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
